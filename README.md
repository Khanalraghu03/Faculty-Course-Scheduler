# SoftGreen - Faculty Schedule Form
Faculty Schedule Form

## Description
SoftGreen is creating a scheduling system using forms that teachers will use to choose course sections for each semester. 
The forms must have either a calendar view or drop down menus for teachers to use, and these menus will allow users to see which classes in real time are available and not available.
When a teacher signs up for a course section it must update the forms immediately. 
When teachers click the drop down menus they will be provided with all the details required to sign up for the course sections they wish to sign up for. 
When teachers are finished the system will update and all users currently using the forms will see the updates in real time.
The goal of SoftGreen is to allow teachers to sign up for course sections in an ordered and appealing manor.
